## Project Overview

This E-commerce Marketplace web application allows users to browse products, make purchases, track orders, and more. The project was developed in three key phases:

- **Day 1**: Laying the foundation by creating the basic UI and structure.
- **Day 2**: Setting up the technical foundation with Next.js for server-side rendering and Sanity CMS for content management.
- **Day 3**: API integrations to handle dynamic product data, cart management, and checkout functionality.

The goal of this project was to create a full-fledged E-commerce website using modern technologies like Next.js and Sanity, allowing for seamless content management and an optimized user experience.
